Once upon a time there was a Queen who had a beautiful baby daughter.  She asked all of the fairies in the kingdon to the christening, but unfortunately forgot to invite one of them, who was a bit of a witch as well.  She came anyway, but as she passed the baby's cradle, she said "When you are sixteen, you will injure yourself on a spindle and die!"
